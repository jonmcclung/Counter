A project I'm working on to learn about Android. It is simple, but has basic functionality. I hope to work on it more when I have more time. Currently it demonstrates knowledge in several important features of Android, including the activity life cycle, sending intents and receiving results, coordinating animations between components, persistant state using a database, and updating the database. It also demonstrates adding, updating, deleting, and rearranging items in a RecyclerView that, at all times, reflects the current state of the database.

To run, import into Android Studio and build.

The goal for this program is for it to keep track of different "counts" (the number of times something has happened) and give you an easy way to increment and otherwise modify that number.

Ignore the Settings page for now, it does nothing useful.
